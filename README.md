# iTunes M4A Tag Editor

Change the 'name' and 'email' tags on purchased iTunes M4A files. Upon first launch, users are given three options:

- create backups for the songs on which this program is used - in case there is an uncaught error in the processing of a song,
- retrieve and use the largest possible cover arts for songs,
- recursively look for subfolders within the given directory, and edit the tags on the songs found within.

## Installation

Tag Editor requires a few dependencies in order to function as expected.

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Enter your name and email address (this will not be transmitted across any network, it will only be stored locally).
2. Choose whether you would like to create backups and if you would like to use the largest cover arts in your songs.
3. Drag the song/album into the program **or** copy the directory of the file, or equally the directory of the folder the file is held in, and paste it into the program.

## Notice

This program is only to be used in the case where the purchaser has changed their name, or their email address. I am not responsible for any misuse of this software.
