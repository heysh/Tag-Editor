# Purchased M4A Tag Editor

Change the 'name' and 'email' tags on purchased M4A files. The program will recursively look for any subfolders and edit the tags on songs found within them.
Upon first launch, users are given the option to create backups for their files, and if they would like to use the largest possible cover arts.

## Installation

Tag Editor v2 requires a few dependencies in order to function as expected.

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Enter your name and email address (this will not be transmitted across any network, it will only be stored locally).
2. Choose whether you would like to create backups and if you would like to use the largest cover arts in your songs.
3. Drag the song/album into the program **or** copy the directory of the file, or equally the directory of the folder the file is held in, and paste it into the program.
